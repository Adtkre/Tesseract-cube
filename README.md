# 4D Tesseract Projection using Python Turtle

A clean and real-time animated visualization of a **4-dimensional hypercube (tesseract)** projected into 3D space, and then into 2D for display using Python's built-in `turtle` module.

This project demonstrates concepts in higher-dimensional geometry, rotation matrices, and perspective projection â€” all visualized in pure Python without external libraries.
